                <p>Aus-Precolour is a high quality product providing vibrant UV resistant colouring in a hardwearing recycled rubber surface, utilising our unique pre-colouring technique. Aus-Precolour makes a consistent brightly coloured surfacing a cost effective option for a wide range of applications. Site poured to provide a seamless soft-fall surface.

Standard colours available are: light and dark green, terracotta, light red, light and dark blue, grey and gold.</p>

            <h2>Aus-EPDM Rubber Flooring</h2>
            <p>Aus-EPDM is an imported, granulated and non-recycled rubber surfacing as seen in some fast food chains and sporting facilities internationally. Site poured to provide a seamless soft-fall surface. Available in a variety of vibrant single or multi coloured finishes. The binder used can produce some initial "yellowing" to the finished surface. This is normally only visually noticeable on lighter colours. This is only temporary and is generally accepted as an industry standard with this product. Please be aware that EPDM is subject to cosmetic colour changes if exposed to direct UV sunlight over a period of time.</p>
